2.   Learn pygame and write several examples to draw points, lines and make sounds for simple 2D and 3D games.
3.   Learn how the Wii'd python module works and how it communicates with the bluetooth Nintendo Wii game controllers and balance board.   Write some short examples.
4.   Integrate all of this knowlege to make some simple example games.
5.   Next write more complicated games with advanced graphics for execercise purposes improving skills in all of the above.
6.   Finally, make an addictive excercise game to play against an intelligent, but insane, AI bot that is bottled inside the computer and get buff.
